# Off-line and on-line Bayesian filtering

In sequential settings, Bayesian parameter estimation can be performed either in an off-line (batch) or an on-line (recursive) framework. This repository contains Matlab implementations of different Bayesian filters, whose goal is the quantification of the full posterior uncertainty of time-invariant model parameters in long-term monitoring settings. These are the following:
