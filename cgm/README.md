# Instructions

- The file cgm_stat_rng1.mat contains all the MATLAB data created from the underlying true problem setup, i.e., the underlying true cgm model and the corresponding synthetic sequential crack monitoring measurements. This file is imported in all three cgm_PFGM.m, cgm_IBIS.m, cgm_SMC.m MATLAB scripts, importing also many functions which are then used in these three scripts.
- The file rs_val.mat contains all the MATLAB data containing all the necessary output information of the reference solution, created via rejection sampling.
